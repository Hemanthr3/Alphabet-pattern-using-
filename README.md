Creation of alphabets shaped patterns using *
Figure out the logic to print a box with all parallel and diagonal lines.
Now as per the shape of the alphabet , modify the logic to print the respective alphabet shape.
While taking the size of the pattern , always make sure to enter an odd for good shape.
You can also make the size constant, instead of taking it as user input.
